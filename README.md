# Ti-Basic-BTC-Miner
A bitcoin miner for Texas Instruments calculators (Ti-83 Premium CE/TI-84 Plus CE) fully written in Ti-Basic. It should work on other TI calculators, but I can't check that since I only have one. It written on a Ti-83 Premium CE (french edition of the TI-84 Plus CE), OS version 5.2.0. It can't generate bitcoins since it's well to slow to mine of the actual blockchain - it uses old blocks info.
